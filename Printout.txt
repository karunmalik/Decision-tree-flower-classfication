After feeding the tree for 50 times the probability of unreliable node:  0.8181818181818182

As it is evident from the data that the probability of most unreliable node increases with every iterations.
The sample output of the probability of the most unreliable node after every iteration is as follows:-

0.5964912280701754,0.5964912280701754,0.5964912280701754,0.5964912280701754,0.5964912280701754,0.6415094339622641,0.6415094339622641,0.6415094339622641,

0.8181818181818182

This is due to the fact that every iteration replaces the most unreliable node with a dission stump, thus increasing the probability of the most unreliable node.

Also, I have included a chart showing the this data plotted on a graph. Please find attached pdf file containing the graph.
